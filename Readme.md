# üì∞ Google News Streamlit App

A simple Streamlit app that fetches Google News RSS feeds by trending, category, or search query, and generates short summaries and top images using Newspaper3k.  
Includes variants of the UI (tabs/sidebar) across multiple scripts for experimentation.

---

##  Features
- **Fetch by mode**: Trending, Categories (WORLD, BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY, etc.), and free-text Search via Google News RSS.  
- **Auto-summary**: Pulls article content with Newspaper3k and produces concise summaries after parsing and NLP.  
- **Top image preview**: Attempts to render the article‚Äôs top image; falls back to a local placeholder if not present (first script).  
- **Streamlit UI**: Multiple layout variants (centered columns, minimal, and sidebar) implemented in separate files.

##  Getting started

###  Prerequisites
- Python **3.9+** recommended  
- Install system build tools if required by Newspaper3k (`lxml`, `libxml2`, `libxslt` on some OSes)  
- Some sites may require a custom user agent and timeouts for Newspaper3k to download reliably  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

pip install -U pip
pip install streamlit newspaper3k beautifulsoup4 pillow lxml

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run


streamlit run App.py


#  Usage

Trending: Loads top stories from Google News RSS
 and lists items with summaries and images when available.

Categories: Select from WORLD, NATION, BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, SCIENCE, HEALTH; the app fetches the corresponding topic feed and summarizes articles.

Search: Enter a query; the app requests Google News search RSS and summarizes results.

Expander & styles:

Main app shows each item with an expander revealing the summary and ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù link.

Some variants use styled headings via st.markdown.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

User agent/timeouts: If some domains block Newspaper3k, configure Article with a custom Config user agent and request_timeout.

Image fallback: Ensure Meta/no_image.jpg exists if using the first script‚Äôs fallback path; update the path if needed.

Limits: Sliders in the main script control how many items to display per mode.
